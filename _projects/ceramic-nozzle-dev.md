## Overview

Typical solid rocket motors rely on transient methods -- such as ablation or heat-sinking -- for managing heat transfer through the nozzle and maintaining acceptable temperatures in the motor case. A large motor can use an ablative nozzle, which might erode by several millimeters during the motor burn; since these few millimeters represent only a small fraction of the nozzle throat diameter, the motor's thrust barely changes. A short-duration motor can rely on simple heat-sinking methods; the heat capacity of the motor case is often sufficient such that the heat transferred to it during the short motor burn does not unreasonably increase the temperature. However, these methods do not work for a small, long-endurance solid rocket motors. The nozzles for these motors require a steady-state insulation technique to ensure the temperature limits of the motor case material are not exceeded. 

## Nozzle material and design considerations

These nozzles are designed for a small, rocket-powered, low-thrust, long-endurance aircraft concept described [here](https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38104). This aircraft concept utilizes a long-endurance solid rocket motor with a specially developed class of slow-burning solid rocket propellants.

The materials and design for these nozzles should be chosen to provide a high maximum service temperature (the operating temperature of the nozzle is 1500 - 2000 K), a low thermal conductivity (< 5 W m<sup>-1</sup> K<sup>-1</sup>), and good thermal shock properties with a critical fracture temperature change $$ \Delta T_f$$ > 1000 K. 

## Nozzle 1: Two-piece ceramic nozzle with 3D-printed cellular ceramic insulator

*This nozzle was designed in collaboration with Dr. Matthew Vernacchia, and more information can be found in our paper [here](https://doi.org/10.2514/1.B38104).* 

Dr. Vernacchia and I designed a two-piece nozzle configuration with a 3D-printed cellular ceramic nozzle insulator.
