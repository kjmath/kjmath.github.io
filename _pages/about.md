I'm Kelly Mathesius - an engineer, maker, and PhD Candidate in the MIT Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, graduating in May 2023. I currently do research in high-temperature materials, solid rocket propulsion, rocket exhaust plume radiant emission, and computational optimization of constrained aircraft design.
